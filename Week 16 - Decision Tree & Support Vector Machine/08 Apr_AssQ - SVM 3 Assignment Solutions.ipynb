    "\n",
    "1. Robustness to Outliers: MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared. This means that large outliers in your dataset won't disproportionately influence the MAE, making it a more reliable metric when dealing with data containing outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Absolute Error: MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. This makes it a straightforward and interpretable metric. Each prediction error is considered without squaring it, which ensures that outliers have a limited impact on the overall metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Real-world Interpretation: In applications such as predicting house prices, where outliers might represent extreme cases (e.g., very high-end properties), understanding the absolute magnitude of the prediction error can be more meaningful than squared errors."

    "In such cases, you can consider several factors to make your decision:\n",

    "1. Interpretability: MSE (Mean Squared Error) is directly interpretable as the average squared error between the predicted and actual values. On the other hand, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the square root of MSE and represents the average absolute error. RMSE is in the same unit as the target variable, making it more interpretable when the target variable's scale matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sensitivity to Outliers: RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MSE because it involves taking the square root. If your dataset contains outliers, RMSE can give more weight to these extreme errors, potentially making it a better choice when you want to penalize large errors more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ease of Optimization: Some optimization algorithms might work more effectively with MSE than with RMSE because the squared term in MSE makes it smoother and less prone to numerical instability during optimization. So, if computational efficiency is a concern, you might prefer MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preference for Smaller or Larger Errors: RMSE penalizes larger errors more than MSE because it involves a square root. If you want to emphasize reducing larger errors, RMSE might be more appropriate."
