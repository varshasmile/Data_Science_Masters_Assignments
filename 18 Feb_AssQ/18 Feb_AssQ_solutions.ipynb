    "An example where an API is used in real life is when you use a mobile weather application to get real-time weather information. The weather application itself doesn't generate the weather data but relies on an API provided by a weather service. In this scenario, the API acts as a bridge between the weather service and the weather application, enabling them to interact and exchange data seamlessly."
