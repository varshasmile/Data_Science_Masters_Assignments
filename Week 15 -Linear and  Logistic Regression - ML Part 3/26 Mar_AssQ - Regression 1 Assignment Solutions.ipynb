    "\n",
    "Assumptions of linear regression include:\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.\n",
    "- Check: Create scatter plots of each independent variable against the dependent variable.\n",
    "- What to Look For: Look for a linear pattern. A roughly linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Check: Ensure that the data points are collected independently. For time-series data, check for autocorrelation by plotting residuals against time or using statistical tests like the Durbin-Watson test.\n",
    "- What to Look For: Look for Durbin – Watson (DW) statistic. It must lie between 0 and 4. If DW = 2, implies no autocorrelation, 0 < DW < 2 implies positive autocorrelation while 2 < DW < 4 indicates negative autocorrelation. Also, you can see residual vs time plot and look for the seasonal or correlated pattern in residual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "- Check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values. You can also use statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or White's test. Look for a consistent spread of residuals across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "- What to Look For: Residuals should have a roughly constant spread as you move along the predicted values. No funnel-like or cone-shaped patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The errors follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- Check: Create a histogram of the residuals or a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot). You can also use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.\n",
    "- What to Look For: Residuals should approximately follow a bell-shaped curve in the histogram or closely align with the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. A p-value from a normality test greater than 0.05 indicates normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "- Check: Calculate correlation coefficients between pairs of independent variables. Alternatively, compute the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each variable. High correlations (> 0.7 or 0.8) or high VIF values (> 5 or 10) suggest multicollinearity.\n",
    "- What to Look For: Low or moderate correlations between independent variables and VIF values below a certain threshold, typically 5 or 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. No endogeneity: There is no relationship between the errors and the independent variables.\n",
    "- Check: This assumption can be challenging to test directly. However, you can consider using instrumental variables or methods like two-stage least squares (2SLS) if you suspect endogeneity."
