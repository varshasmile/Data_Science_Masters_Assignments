    "Unsupervised learning is commonly used in anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns or outliers within a dataset. Anomalies are data points that deviate significantly from the expected norm or regular behavior. Unsupervised learning techniques are well-suited for this task because they can learn the inherent structure of the data without requiring labeled examples of anomalies.\n",
